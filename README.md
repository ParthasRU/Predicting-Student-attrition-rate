# Predicting-Student-attrition-rate
Project Description: Clearwater State University offers a wide variety of degree programs, from online degrees to a doctorate in education.
Programs are offered in the streams of the arts, education, business & nursing.
Some key strategic goals of the University are:
• Increase enrolment of students
• Improve retention, progression and graduation rates
• Recruit better academically qualified undergraduate and graduate students
• Increase external funding and recognition
Business Questions: Leverage data on student demographic profile, course preferences, performance record, grades, financial background, financial aid and other application information to:
1. Identify key drivers of early student attrition
2. Build a predictive model to identify students with higher early attrition risk
3. Recommend appropriate interventions based on the analysis
Note: Early attrition is defined as student drop out within one year of successfully joining the program (completed admission process)
